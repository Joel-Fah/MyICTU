# MyICTU

> Your academic life, in your pocket.

MyICTU is a mobile application that reimagines the ICT University student portal as a unified, student-centered experience. Built around the student's existing `@ictuniversity.edu.cm` identity, it brings together the tools and information that currently live in separate places — turning a fragmented workflow into a seamless academic companion.

## The Problem

At ICT University, students manage their academic life through a combination of the student portal, email attachments, and in-person office visits that together form a fragmented experience. During critical periods like result releases or registration deadlines, the portal becomes slow and unreliable, while essential information like timetables arrives as spreadsheet files, announcements go unnoticed, and processes like payment validation and course registration still require physical presence. The institutional Google Workspace accounts every student holds remain largely disconnected from this experience, and there is no mobile-native way to stay on top of academic life — leaving the overall system functional in parts, but lacking the cohesion students need.

## The Solution

MyICTU addresses this as a whole — not by replacing the portal, but by extending it into a cohesive, mobile-first experience. It offers offline access to key academic information so that server load never stands between a student and their data, push notifications for announcements and deadlines so nothing gets missed, and smart timetable integration that syncs directly to Google Calendar. Paired with a redesigned interface that puts student needs first, MyICTU turns scattered academic tools into one experience that just works.
